seed=

	~	 [0,32000,1]
	~	Seed for the random number generator - stream ID for the distribution to use.  If s \
		is set to 0 the default noise stream will be used.  The default noise \
		stream can be controlled using the NOISE SEED variable described below.  \
		For each distinct non-zero value of s a separate noise stream will be \
		created.  You can couple noise streams by giving them the same stream ID. \
		When streams are coupled it means that the random selections will \
		influence one another, not that they will be the same. For example if \
		there are two functions using the stream ID 7, adding a third with the \
		same stream ID will change the noise generated by the first two. Using a \
		nonzero stream ID is most useful if it is unique so that adding additional \
		random functions will not influence a particular drawing sequence. See the \
		examples below. The stream ID should almost always be 0 or, if nonzero, a \
		constant. Using a dynamic value for StreamID can consume excessive memory. 
		NOTE  The noise stream ID for a random variable should be a number or a \
		constant.  If you make the ID a variable a new noise stream will be \
		started each time the value of that variable changes. This will slow \
		things and also degrade the distributional quality of the random variable.
